    <p>
      Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours, accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per description (versus 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences, facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model, MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen.  </p>

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            We investigate the impact of the <strong>number of residual layers</strong> and the <strong>number of tokens</strong> on VQ reconstruction quality. Additionally, we compare our method against the 6-layer VQ used in MoMask. The number of tokens is calculated based on the encoding of a 320-frame motion sequence. Results show that our approach effectively captures high-fidelity motion details by increasing the number of layers and tokens, enabling better modeling of holistic motion patterns compared to the RVQ used in MoMask.<br><br>

             We analyze the effect of <strong>residual tokens</strong>, <strong>multi-scale quantization</strong>, and <strong>prompt rewriting</strong> on the final motion generation quality. As shown below, using only a single VQ token sequence (<span style="color:red;">w/o residual VQ</span>) or multiple full-scale token sequences of the same length (<span style="color:red;">w/o multi-scale VQ</span>) results in limited understanding of nuanced text prompts. Moreover, when casual user prompts are directly used (<span style="color:red;">w/o prompt rewriting</span>) for generation without rewriting, the model exhibits significant semantic degradation. <br>
